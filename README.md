XChangeIt 🛒🧠

#Problem Statement-
<br>
People often have useful items like books or tools that are no longer needed, while others are searching for the same things. There is no dedicated platform to enable trusted, community-driven resource exchange or resale — leading to waste and missed connections.We aim to solve this by creating a platform where users can share, exchange, or sell resources, while building connections and trust within the community

#Objective-
<br>
We’ve built a web platform for resource sharing and exchange, where users can: 
● Post items (like books) they want to give away,
exchange, or sell
● Browse listings posted by others
● Use real-time chat to negotiate exchanges or
purchases
● Build a trusted system of reuse within their local or
digital community.

#Tech Stack-
<br>
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br>
Backend: JavaScript
<br>
UI/UX Designing : Figma

#Current Progress (Mid Evaluation)
